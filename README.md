## The Vorender 4

The Vorender 4 is an upcycling of my Creality Ender 4 that was laying in parts.

It uses the profiles of the frame from the Ender 4, the bed and it associated smooth rods and lead screw, the power supply.

The gantry is the one of the Voron 2.4 modified to use MGN12 linear rails instead of the specified MGN9 that can not fit on vslots extrusion

## Integration of a 5015 blower fan for the Afterburner

This project is about replacing the default 4020 blower of the Afterburner toolhead by a more powerfull 5015 one while keeping the aesthetic of the tool head

## Modular fan duct

This project is liked to the previous one. It is aimed at optimizing the use of the airflow from the 5015 blower.

This is a modular fan duct where the tips of the duct are separate pieces that can be printed in about 20 minutes therefore enabling to quickly test several configurations to iterate on the design, replace them if they melt, having different tips depending on what you are printing (PLA vs ABS for instance).

It is available for all supported toolheads (Mosquito, E3D V6, Dragon) but has only been tested on the Mellow NF Crazy Mosquito clone (which performs pretty nicely.
